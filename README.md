Developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for hospital emergency room visits, providing real-time insights into patient demographics, visit patterns, and departmental referrals.

Analyzed patient visit data to distinguish between administrative (50.04%) and non-administrative appointments (49.96%), enhancing resource allocation and operational efficiency.

Visualized patient visit trends by various dimensions, such as week type (weekday: 6.6K, weekend: 2.6K) and age group (adults: 7.1K), supporting data-driven decision-making.

Monitored key performance indicators, including average patient satisfaction (5.47) and average wait time (35.26 minutes), to improve patient care and service delivery.
